Goal: Choose a real-world dataset that is interesting to us, and 'mine' it.
Partner: jguerra

The data set we chose is from UCI Machine Learning Repository.  It combines census data with violent crime data.  The goal of the data set is to predict the number of violent crimes pero 100k people.  We will be looking to build a classification model to see if cities with low/high crime rate can be predicted based on other data.

A sample of the data can be found in the csv file.  Here is a description of the attributes:
