Project 1.5
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Goal: Run some classifiers on the medical dataset.

I first ran the ZeroR classifier on the dataset with a couple unique attributes 
removed (such as Patient ID, etc...).  However, this resulted in a pretty bad error 
rate.  The complete results can be found in the file "ZeroR_initial_result.txt".
The summary of this run was as follows:

=== Summary ===
Correctly Classified Instances       44001               44.0014 %
Incorrectly Classified Instances     55998               55.9986 %
Kappa statistic                          0     
Mean absolute error                      0.0838
Root mean squared error                  0.2046
Relative absolute error                100      %
Root relative squared error            100      %
Total Number of Instances            99999     

I then looked at the visualizer graphs for each attribute and it seemed hat a 
couple were giving the classifier a lot of extra noise.  In order to alleviate 
this, I decided to play around with the data and remove the following fields 
out of curiosity:
Other-Dx-Code-X (with X= 1 -> 14)
Other-PR-Code-X (with X= 1 -> 14)
CMCX (with X= 2 -> 10)
PLX (with X= 2 -> 5)

However, the classifier still had the same results:

=== Summary ===

Correctly Classified Instances       44001               44.0014 %
Incorrectly Classified Instances     55998               55.9986 %
Kappa statistic                          0     
Mean absolute error                      0.0838
Root mean squared error                  0.2046
Relative absolute error                100      %
Root relative squared error            100      %
Total Number of Instances            99999 

I then looked at the confusion matrix, and found that it was classifying everything 
as disposition code 1.  This was the most common disposition code, however obviously 
the classifier wasn't finding a very good way to classify patients.

For the purposes of our experiment, it wasn't very useful to have a classifier that 
could classify EVERY disposition code available.  Our project questions were mainly 
concerned with finding a way to predict the disposition codes of 
20 (Hospice - Medical Facility) and 2 (Other Acute Care Hospital).  In order to 
reduce the amount of noise in the dataset, perhaps the classifications could be 
reduced to simply: 20, 2, or anything else.
